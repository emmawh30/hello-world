# hello-world
My First Project

Hi My name is Emma, this year I began my education into coding and in January 2017 will be attending a 3 month Web Development bootcamp.

For three months, I will be learning more advanced coding languages for front end web development and also back end database, API, AWS so by the time I have finished i will be able to apply for Junior Full Stack development roles.
